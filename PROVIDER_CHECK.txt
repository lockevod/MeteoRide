Provider ID consistency check

Summary:
- Canonical provider IDs chosen: openmeteo, meteoblue, openweather, aromehd, compare
- Chains added: ow2_arome_openmeteo, arome_openmeteo

Files updated:
- utils.js: providerChains use 'openweather' and 'aromehd'; resolveProviderForTimestamp special-case uses 'openweather' and returns 'aromehd' when appropriate.
- ui.js: fixed option id used to disable OpenWeather-based options (openweathermap -> openweather); injected new chain options.
- index.html: selector options include 'ow2_arome_openmeteo' and 'arome_openmeteo'; uses 'aromehd' and 'openweather' where appropriate.

Notes:
- app.js already handles 'aromehd' (special buildProviderUrl branch) and 'openweather' for OpenWeather requests, so no further changes were needed there.
- If you want a repository-wide grep for the four tokens (openweathermap/openweather/arome/aromehd) I can add a small script to run locally, or I can manually edit any other file you point out.

If you want full automatic renames across the repo, tell me and I will perform conservative replacements where unambiguous.
