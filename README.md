# MeteoRide

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **MeteoRide** is a web application designed for cyclists to forecast detailed weather in a route. Load GPX files, select your cycling speed, and get comprehensive weather data along your path, including temperature, wind, precipitation, humidity, cloudiness, luminosity, and UV index.

## Features

- **GPX Route Loading**: Supports standard tracks, routes, and waypoints. Load files directly or via URLs with parameters like `?gpx_url=` or `?gpx_data=`.
- **Weather Providers**: Choose from Open-Meteo (free, up to 14 days), MeteoBlue (API key required, up to 7 days), OpenWeather (API key required, up to 5 days), or Arome-HD (high-resolution for Europe within 48 hours).
- **Comparison Mode**: Evaluate differences between providers for better decision-making.
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Switches to Open-Meteo if your primary provider fails or exceeds its horizon, with optional notifications.
- **Interactive Weather Table**: Displays hourly data with icons, temperature, wind (speed + direction + gusts), rain (amount + probability), humidity, cloudiness, luminosity bar, and UV index.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize wind arrows (blue for light <12 km/h, red for strong 30-50 km/h, purple for very strong >50 km/h), precipitation drops, and route markers.
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: Drag or scroll the table horizontally on touch screens; click columns to highlight and center the map.
- **Solar Information**: Automatic sunrise/sunset times, civil twilight, and real luminosity calculations.
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Handles provider failures, retries, and clear notifications on data limitations.
- **URL Parameters**: Direct links for routes, e.g., `?gpx_url=https://example.com/route.gpx`, `?datetime=2024-03-15T10:00`, `?speed=25`.
- **Local Caching**: Stores provider responses in localStorage for ~30 minutes per step/hour to speed up reloads and reduce API calls.
- **Settings**: API key management with check buttons, units (wind: km/h/m/s/mph; temperature: ¬∞C/¬∞F; distance: km/mi; precipitation: mm/in), and language support (English/Spanish).
- **Privacy-Focused**: Runs entirely on your device; no data sent to external servers. Only shares coordinates, dates, and API keys with weather providers.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable on mobile and desktop devices for a native app-like experience.
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed, available on GitHub for contributions.

## Howto use
You can use in your own computer, only download the code and open index.html in your computer.
You can use directly in a web (it's the same code published by github pages directly). You can use https://app.meteoride.cc

## Getting Started

1. **Load a GPX Route**: Click the üìÅ button or use URL parameters.
2. **Set Date and Time**: Choose your planned start time (auto-adjusts to 15-minute intervals).
3. **Adjust Speed**: Enter average speed or use presets (5, 10, 12, 15, 20 km/h).
4. **Select Interval**: Choose weather data every 15 or 30 minutes.
5. **Pick Provider**: Select a weather source and enable comparison if needed.

## Limitations and Tips

- **Time Horizons**: Open-Meteo (14 days), MeteoBlue (7 days), OpenWeather (5 days). Implemented a fallback with Meteoblue and openweathermap (more than standard days fallback to open-meteo)
- **Accuracy**: Forecasts less reliable beyond 3-4 days.
- **Free APIs**: Monthly limits for MeteoBlue and OpenWeather; Open-Meteo has no limits.
- **Best Practices**: Use routes up to 100-200 km, plan 1-2 days ahead, combine sources, have a backup plan, and carry rain gear.

## Troubleshooting

- **GPX Won't Load**: Ensure the file has valid tracks.
- **No Weather Data**: Check API key or switch to Open-Meteo.
- **Date Out of Range**: Reduce the time horizon.
- **Empty Table**: Verify route length.

## Privacy and Data

MeteoRide operates locally in your browser. Data shared with providers includes only coordinates, dates, and API keys. Local storage includes settings, encrypted API keys, preferences, and temporary weather cache. This is for donwloaded code and with code in github pages (https://app.meteoride.cc)
